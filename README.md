### More About ME

- My First and Middle names are part of a unique tradition in Ghana to name the child by the day of the week I was born. We typically have two sets of names to choose from depending on the day and the gender of the newborn baby. As a Friday-born male I was assigned with the name _Kofi_. Hypothetically, say my sister was born on a Friday as well, she would be named Afua or Afua. 
- My parents are both directly from **Ghana**, they lived there for the early half of their lives before moving to California. My dad is from the Fanti tribe while my mom comes from the Ashanti tribe, one of the largest and _most well-known Ghanaian tribes in the nation_.
